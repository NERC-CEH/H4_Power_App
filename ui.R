This pseudo data is then analysed as if the data had been obtained in reality and a formal statistical test is conducted to assess whether the effect (trend or treatment) is significant. This process is repeated, storing the number of times that the effect was detected. 
			This is therefore based on the premise of simulating data that represents the particular metrics under consideration and the different scenarios relating to the monitoring intensity and extent as well as a hypothetical change to detect. Data are simulated using existing data sources to understand the distribution and variability over space and time of particular metrics. Critically, existing data are used to establish the key properties and parameters of the distribution of the data to enable realistic simulations to be derived. Important parameters to be established include the shape of the distribution, any upper or lower limits, variation over space, and variation over time. From these properties, pseudo data sets are generated according to the spatial and temporal monitoring scenarios in a parametric bootstrap approach.

					We start with considering the structure of the survey design. The two major components of the design are how many observations are there and over what time period is being considered. For individual-based observations, this is simply just the number of individuals per year observed and the total number of years of the (hypothtical) survey. 
					For site-based data, there is another aspect. There is the number of sites per year and the total time period (as with the indivudual case), but there is also the possibility of taking multiple measurements (often called replciates) from the same site. This is shown below. "),

In simple cases, this may just be every year, but there may be other designs whereby each site is only repeated every few years but with some sampling of sites undertaken in every year of survey. This is shown in the figure below and is often referred to as a rotating panel design, where the panels in this sense represent a particular subset of sites. 
					In this example sites are revisited every 5 years - shown by the same subset of point coloured 5 years apart - but an equal number of sites is still monitored each year. The total number of unique sites is therefore given by the number of sites per year multiplied by the length of time between revisits.

The structure follows the assumption that there are a number of sites monitored over time, within which a number of replicate samples are taken. The sites are then repeatedly surveyed throughout the survey according to a specified frequency. The distribution of the data was assumed to be normally distributed on the log scale. The variance of this distribution represents the residual error in the data. The mean of this distribution was defined in a hierarchical manner with each replicate sample having its own mean value, which depended on the site level mean. This is shown diagrammatically in the figure below showing the structure of the data with site (shown in blue) and replicate samples (shown in grey) following some underlying distribution (i.e. each sample at each site has its own average value). On top of this a trend effect is imposed (red dots) and finally some residual variability is added (black squares). There are four different parameters to simulate the data which starts with an average site value (shown in orange) and some between site variation around this (blue). Repeat observations at each site are then distributed around the corresponding site mean with some additional between replicate variance (grey). The time trend (effect) is then imposed on the data and some residual error around this is included (black). This structure was established based on a key exemplar data set. "),

There are just three components to the data that is simulated that represent the mean (red line in the figure below) and variance (the spread of the histogram below) of the concentrations in each individual and an additional residual variation terms which adds some random noise around the imposed trend (effect of interest) over time.
