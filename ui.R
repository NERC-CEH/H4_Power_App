This pseudo data is then analysed as if the data had been obtained in reality and a formal statistical test is conducted to assess whether the effect (trend or treatment) is significant. This process is repeated, storing the number of times that the effect was detected. 
			This is therefore based on the premise of simulating data that represents the particular metrics under consideration and the different scenarios relating to the monitoring intensity and extent as well as a hypothetical change to detect. Data are simulated using existing data sources to understand the distribution and variability over space and time of particular metrics. Critically, existing data are used to establish the key properties and parameters of the distribution of the data to enable realistic simulations to be derived. Important parameters to be established include the shape of the distribution, any upper or lower limits, variation over space, and variation over time. From these properties, pseudo data sets are generated according to the spatial and temporal monitoring scenarios in a parametric bootstrap approach.

The variance of this distribution represents the residual error in the data.

This is shown diagrammatically in the figure below showing the structure of the data with site (shown in blue) and replicate samples (shown in grey) following some underlying distribution (i.e. each sample at each site has its own average value). On top of this a trend effect is imposed (red dots) and finally some residual variability is added (black squares). There are four different parameters to simulate the data which starts with an average site value (shown in orange) and some between site variation around this (blue). Repeat observations at each site are then distributed around the corresponding site mean with some additional between replicate variance (grey).
