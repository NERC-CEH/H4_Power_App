# H4 Power App

This repository contains code for a R shiny application that conducts simulations to estimate power under hypothetical design scenarios to detect change in contaminants in the environment. The app can be used to determine the type of change over time a given survey design could reliably detect, as well as trying out different survey designs to see how much data is needed to reliably detect a given change over time. The app supports survey designs based on repeat visits to sites with within-site replication and also sampling of individuals over time (i.e. no repeat visits).

The app contains within it instructions and example usages, as well as parameter estimates based on real data sources.

Code originally written by Pete Henrys and Fiona Seaton of UKCEH for Defra/the Environment Agency.
